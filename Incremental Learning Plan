## Goals
Finish Tier X by October 1
Finish App Academy Open by April 1
Finish CS50 by February 1
Finish CS50 Web Programming with Python by April 1
Finish GeeksForGeeks C programming by February 1
Finish GeeksForGeeks Python programming by April 1
Have three substantial projects forming the bulk of a professional portfolio by mid-July.
Have a complete, professional looking, well thought out resume/CV by the end of July.
Have studied algorithms and data structures and done hundreds on problems on HackerRank by the end of July.
Have researched available jobs in your area by the first week of April, and use that research to drive your entire effort from April to July as you prepare your portfolio and resume/CV to demonstrate that you are well qualified to fulfill the responsibilities for the jobs that most align with the future you want.

## Schedule
September: Tier X on Khan Academy (all available time)
October: App Academy Open (40-50 hours/week)
November: App Academy Open (20 hours/week), CS50 (20 hours/week)
December: App Academy Open (20 hours/week), CS50/GeeksForGeeks-C (20 hours/week)
January: App Academy Open (20 hours/week), CS50/GeeksForGeeks-Python (20 hours/week)
February: App Academy Open (20 hours/week), CS50 Web Programming with Python/GeeksForGeeks-Python (20 hours/week)
March: App Academy Open (30 hours/week), CS50 Web Programming with Python (10 hours/week)
April: Research jobs in your local area (not to apply, but to see what's available), pick a backend language that is desirable in your area, study it. Study the docs. Study it on GeeksForGeeks. Build one project per week of increasing difficulty.
May-June: Study the Algorithms and Data Structures sections of GeeksForGeeks one day a week. Practice doing problems on HackerRank one day a week. Spend the rest of the week perfecting one spectacular project per month for your portfolio.
July: Clean up projects and assemble a clean looking, aesthetically pleasing, portfolio. Craft your resume/CV. Spend one day a week (minimum) practicing problems on HackerRank or doing problems from a past Google Code Jam.

## Notes
By April, you should have learned how to branch and commit code to Git using meaningful commit messages - ensure you adhere to this during your May-July activities.
You should also have learned the importance of testing, linting, and formatting your code consistently - keep this in mind as well from May-July.
You could freely substitute Full Stack Open for App Academy Open above, it is just as good a resource - the trade off is that App Academy has a bit gentler introduction at the start (though both end at about the same difficulty).
If it looks like you might not finish App Academy Open by the end of March, suck it up and work harder. If you're stuck for more than a day on something, reach out for help, on their slack, on Twitter, whatever.
You NEED the April-July activities. Even if you don't end up in a whiteboard interview, having studied algorithms and data structures will make you a better programmer, and having practiced on Hackerrank will remove the 'fear factor' from the interview process because if they decide to whiteboard you, it'll be old hat by then. You need the 'post learning' projects to craft a professional portfolio - actual projects that you put a month of effort into doing well will demonstrate that you're doing work at the level a prospective employer will expect.
Always give yourself one day off a week to relax. The time off isn't stealing learning time from yourself, it's giving the learning time to sink in and is more productive and sustainable long term.
Eat well - sleep - and workout. Whatever that means for you. I'm not joking about this. Sure, study your ass off, study for 12 hour days if you want - heck, study for 16 hour days if you want - but eat regular meals, get sleep, and have physical activity whether that be walking, jogging, hitting the gym, grabbing a pickup game of some sport you enjoy, whatever, but something. It will power you to learn more.
